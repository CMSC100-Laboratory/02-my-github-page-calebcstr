### How to create a GitHub Page
1. Clone/pull said GitHub repository to local machine
2. Create a HTML file to the repository (optionally with CSS)
3. Push HTML file to GitHub repository
4. Change visibility of said repository to Public
5. Configure the repository by going to GitHub Pages through the settings. Then select a live branch that you will use to host your static website.

### Key Takeaways
